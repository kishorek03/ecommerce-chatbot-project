## 🧠 Backend - Spring Boot

### 📍 Path: `/backend`

The backend is built with Java 17 and Spring Boot, providing a RESTful API to serve data to the chatbot. It uses an **in-memory H2 database** to store the E-commerce dataset, which is loaded from the provided CSV files (`products.csv`, `orders.csv`, `inventory_items.csv`, `order_items.csv`, etc.) at application startup. This ensures fast data access and a quick setup without needing an external database.

### ✅ API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST endpoints to power the chatbot's functionalities:

| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                                                                                                                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/api/chatbot/health`                | Basic health check to confirm the backend service is running.                                                                            |
| `POST` | `/api/chatbot/query`                 | **Main Chatbot Endpoint.** Accepts a user's natural language message and returns a structured response based on intent recognition and data retrieval. <br> **Request Body:** `{ "message": "What is the status of order ID 12345?" }` <br> **Response Body Example (status):** `{ "response": "The status for order ID 12345 is: delivered...", "data": { "orderId": 12345, "status": "delivered", ... } }` <br> **Response Body Example (top products):** `{ "response": "Here are our top 5 most sold products...", "data": [ { "productName": "...", "salesCount": 123 }, ... ] }` |
| `GET`  | `/api/chatbot/products/top`          | Retrieves the top 5 most sold products based on order data.                                                                              |
| `GET`  | `/api/chatbot/categories`            | Fetches a list of all available product categories. (Can be used for guiding chatbot responses or frontend filters).                     |
| `GET`  | `/api/chatbot/inventory/stock`       | Checks the current stock level for a specific product. <br> **Query Param:** `?productName=Classic T-Shirt`                                     |

**Note:** The `/api/chatbot/query` endpoint is designed to be the primary interface, interpreting various questions. The other `GET` endpoints can be used directly for specific, predefined queries or internally by the chatbot service after intent recognition.

### 🧪 Build & Run Locally

To build and run the Spring Boot backend locally (without Docker):

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Build the Spring Boot application (creates a JAR file in `build/libs`):**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build -x test
    ```
    *(The `-x test` flag skips running tests during build. Remove it if you want to run tests.)*
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    java -jar build/libs/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080` (or configured port). You can access the H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` if enabled, using `jdbc:h2:mem:ecommerce` as the JDBC URL.

### 🐳 Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`)

This Dockerfile is optimized for building and running the Spring Boot application within a Docker container. It assumes the JAR is already built locally.

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight JDK 17 base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the port your Spring Boot application runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Copy the built JAR file from your host machine into the container
# This assumes you have already run './gradlew clean build' on your host
ARG JAR_FILE=build/libs/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar

# Command to run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
💻 Frontend - React
📍 Path: /frontend
The frontend provides the user interface for the chatbot, built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend via its REST API to send user queries and display chatbot responses.

🧪 Build & Run Locally
To build and run the React frontend locally (without Docker):

Navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or yarn install
Start the development server:

Bash

npm start
# or yarn start
The frontend will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

🐳 Dockerfile (frontend/Dockerfile)
Dockerfile

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image for building
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the React application
RUN npm run build

# Use a lightweight Nginx image to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the build stage to Nginx's public directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx configuration (optional, if you have one)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose the port Nginx will serve on
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
🚀 Running the Full Stack with Docker Compose
docker-compose.yml orchestrates both the backend and frontend services, allowing you to build and run the entire application with a single command.

Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is running on your system.

Open your terminal in the root directory of the project (ecommerce-chatbot-project/).

Build the backend JAR:

Bash

cd backend
./gradlew clean build -x test
cd .. # Go back to the root project directory
Build and run the entire stack using Docker Compose:

Bash

docker-compose up --build
--build ensures that Docker images for both services are built (or rebuilt if changes occurred) before starting the containers.

This command will:

Build the backend Docker image (copying the pre-built JAR).

Build the frontend Docker image.

Start both containers.

Access the application:

Frontend (Chatbot UI): http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost if you configured Nginx to listen on port 80 directly and map to 80 in docker-compose.yml)

Backend API: http://localhost:8080 (accessible from the frontend service and for direct testing)

To stop the services:

Bash

docker-compose down
🔮 Future Enhancements
JWT Authentication: Implement Spring Security with JWT for secure API access.

Real Database Integration: Migrate from H2 in-memory to a persistent database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Advanced NLP Integration: Integrate with external Natural Language Processing (NLP) services like Google Dialogflow, AWS Lex, or even self-hosted solutions like Rasa for more sophisticated intent recognition and entity extraction.

Deployment to Cloud Platforms: Deploy the backend to AWS EC2/ECS/Elastic Beanstalk and the frontend to Netlify/Vercel or an S3 bucket with CloudFront.

Conversational Context: Implement state management for multi-turn conversations in the chatbot.

Improved Chatbot UI/UX: Add typing indicators, message timestamps, scroll-to-bottom, etc.

this is like preview , not code, give me readme code directly, so that i can copy paste , think and give , dont do the same , i need code alone


Got it! My apologies for the misunderstanding. You need the raw Markdown content for the README.md file, ready for copy-pasting, not a preview or explanation around it.
